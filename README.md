# Weather-App
A weather app had been developed by just using HTML, CSS and Javascript along with a weather API. As the name of city or state is entered, it shows the current weather of that area and also the minimum and maximum temperature on that day.

This is the sample output on giving Uttar Pradesh as an input when asked to enter the name of the area.
